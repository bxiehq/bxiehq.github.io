00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.270
Cell division is required for an organism生物体 to grow, mature, and maintain tissues.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.680
 During the mitotic phase, a cell will undergo mitosis to form two new nuclei细胞核核

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.970
and then divide to form two new individual cells during cytokinesis原浆移动.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.850
Mitosis is the process of dividing the duplicated DNA of a cell into two new nuclei核.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.270
Mitosis is split into distinct stages.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.520
The first stage is prophase早期;

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.220
the DNA condenses浓缩, organizes, and the classic chromosome染色体 structure appears.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.930
Next comes prometaphase前中期 where microtubules微管 attach to the chromosomes.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.020
This step is followed by metaphase中期 where the chromosomes align.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.270
Metaphase is followed by anaphase后期 where the chromosomes separate分离.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.180
Finally, during telophase有丝分裂末期 nuclear membranes核膜 reappear around the two sets of chromosomes染色体.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.060
Mitosis is now complete.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.470
After mitosis two new cells are formed by a process called cytokinesis原浆移动.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.060
Mitosis is only one part of what is called the cell cycle.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.100
For many eukaryotic真核 cells, a cell is duplicated every 24 hours.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.300
Most of the life of a cell is spent in interphase细胞分裂间期.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.320
Interphase consists of three stages called

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.080
G1, S, and G2.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.960
G1 (or Gap 1) is the first growth stage of interphase.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.780
In G1, the cell grows to nearly its full size

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.500
and performs many of its specific biochemical functions that aid the organism有机体.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.100
Next is the S (or synthesis合成) phase.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.560
This is an important stage, because it is during the S phase

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.280
that DNA in the nucleus细胞核 is replicated复制.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.440
The cell next enters another growth stage called G2 (or Gap 2).

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.940
 It is during G2 that the cell finishes growing.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.260
Once the cell has duplicated DNA in the nucleus,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.140
and two centrosomes中心体 have appeared in the cytoplasm细胞质,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.140
mitosis can begin.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.860
For a typical eukaryotic真核 cell this will last about 80 minutes.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.640
During the first stage of mitosis, called prophase前期,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.720
we first see the classic chromosome structure.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.820
This occurs through a condensation聚合 process.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.160
At the same time, protein strands蛋白质链 called microtubules微管

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.860
appear from the centrosomes中心体 in animals.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.240
Finally, a structure found within the nucleus, the nucleolus核仁, disappears.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.300
Next, prometaphase前中期 begins when the nuclear membrane核膜 is broken down.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.840
At the same time, microtubule strands, or spindle fibers纺锤丝,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840
are growing from the centrosomes.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.920
These strands attach to a protein structure called the kinetochore着丝粒.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.000
 One kinetochore is attached to the centromere of each sister chromatid染色单体.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.240
Next comes metaphase中期.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.940
During this stage the sister chromatids染色单体 align along the center of the cell

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.680
so that both chromatids face toward opposite poles极 of the cell.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.520
Now the sister chromatids are ready to be separated.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.500
This occurs during anaphase后期

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.320
through a shortening of the microtubules attached to the kinetochores动粒.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.060
Additionally, the poles of the cell move farther apart

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.800
and cause increased separation of sister chromatids.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.020
At the end of anaphase, the sister chromatids have moved to the two ends of the cell.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.920
Telophase末期 is the final stage of mitosis.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.140
It is here the components of the new cells begin to appear.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.320
At this point the spindle fibers纺锤丝 are broken up.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.180
A new nuclear membrane surrounds the chromosomes染色体 at the end of each cell.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.920
And the chromosomes uncoil展开 and return to an uncondensed未伸展 state.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.500
Mitosis is now complete.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.800
 The formation of two cells is all that remains.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.440
Following mitosis, the cell undergoes a process called cytokinesis原浆移动.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.200
First the cell is compressed by a contractile ring可收缩环 that divides the cell in nearly equal halves.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.320
By now the organelles细胞器 in the cell have been replicated,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.380
and are now divided between the two halves of the cell.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.680
This includes mitochondria线粒体, golgi bodies高尔基体, and the rough ER.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.640
Plant cells also have chloroplasts叶绿体.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.680
Once split, the two new cells are now fully in the G1 stage of interphase分裂间期

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.860
and ready again to begin their growth.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.920
Let’s watch the process one more time.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.940
Mitosis begins with prophase.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.760
Notice the DNA condensing into chromosomes during this stage.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.260
Microtubules appear during prometaphase, and the nuclear membrane breaks down.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.620
Metaphase occurs when the chromosomes are aligned at the center of the cell.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.060
During anaphase the chromosomes are moving apart.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.400
The telophase stage is marked by the appearance of new nuclear membranes.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.860
This is the end of mitosis.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.720
Finally, the splitting of the cell occurs during cytokinesis.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.440
The two new cells are now ready to grow and perform their specialized functions.
